# Ear Training Online

## Description

[Ear Training Online]() is an open-source React web app created by [Max Eidinoff](https://www.maxeidinoff.com/) as a resource for music students, particularly those taking AP Music Theory or an intro undergraduate aural skills course, to practice melodic dictation. This current version is an early prototype that will hopefully continue to grow. User feedback and community code contributions are very much welcome! The goal with this project is to eventually scale difficulty level of exercises with user performance in a highly gamified presentation, rather than isolating aural skill concepts for the user to manually choose from.

## Installation Instructions
